Mauzr
=====

Mauzr is a hardware focussed multi-agent framework written in python. You can
implement your own smart environment or cyber-physical system with help
of this project.

I like to develop smart environments and spend a lot of my time doing so.
When I also started to write my master thesis on a similar topic, I realised
I can save a lot of time merging some of my projects into a development
framework to simplify creation of new agents.
Personally I dislike the assumption that a network can be "*isolated and
secure*", so the framework needs to be secure, robust and reliable.
